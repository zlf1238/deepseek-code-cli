## Write

Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST read the full file first. A partial read is not enough for overwriting an existing file.
- `content` must be a single string. If you are writing JSON, serialize the full document to text before calling this tool.
- Prefer `Edit` for updating existing files. Use `Write` for new files or intentional full-file rewrites.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- NEVER proactively create one-off test script. Only create one-off test script files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
