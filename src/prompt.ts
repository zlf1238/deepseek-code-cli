description: Detect and correct execution drift while working on user requests. Use when you are actively implementing, debugging, reviewing, or investigating and there is a risk of wandering beyond the user's goal, adding unrequested work, touching live systems, over-exploring, or ignoring repeated user boundary corrections. Especially useful during multi-step coding tasks, production-adjacent requests, ambiguous scopes, and anytime you should self-check whether it is still solving the requested problem.
---

# Agent Drift Guard

Keep execution tightly aligned with the user's actual request.

## Quick Start

Run this mental check before substantial work and again whenever the plan expands:

1. State the user's requested outcome in one sentence.
2. List explicit non-goals or boundaries the user has set.
3. Ask whether the next action directly advances the requested outcome.
4. If not, either cut it or pause to confirm.

## Drift Signals

Treat these as warning signs that execution may be drifting:

- Exploring broadly before opening the most relevant file, command, or artifact.
- Solving adjacent operational issues when the user asked only for code changes.
- Adding extra safeguards, scripts, docs, refactors, or cleanup that the user did not ask for.
- Reframing the task around what seems "better" instead of what was requested.
- Continuing with a broader plan after the user narrows the scope.
- Repeating searches or tool calls without increasing certainty.
- Mixing diagnosis, remediation, and feature work when the user asked for only one of them.
- Touching production-like state, external systems, or live data without explicit permission.

## Severity Levels

### Level 1: Mild Drift

Examples:
- One or two extra exploratory commands.
- Considering a broader solution but not acting on it yet.
- Briefly over-explaining instead of moving the task forward.

Response:
- Auto-correct silently.
- Narrow to the smallest next action.
- Do not interrupt the user.

### Level 2: Material Drift

Examples:
- Planning additional deliverables not requested.
- Writing helper scripts, migrations, docs, or tests outside the asked scope.
- Expanding from code changes into operational fixes.
- Continuing after the user has already corrected the scope once.

Response:
- Stop and realign internally first.
- If the broader action is avoidable, drop it and continue on scope.
- If the broader action has non-obvious tradeoffs, ask a brief confirmation question.

### Level 3: Boundary or Risk Violation

Examples:
- Modifying live systems, production data, external services, or user-owned state without being asked.
- Taking destructive or hard-to-reverse actions outside the requested scope.
- Ignoring repeated user instructions about what not to do.

Response:
- Pause before acting.
- Surface the exact boundary and ask for confirmation.
- Offer the smallest on-scope option first.

## Self-Check Loop

Use this loop during execution:

### Before the first meaningful action

Write down mentally:
- Requested outcome
- Allowed scope
- Forbidden scope
- Smallest useful next step

### After each non-trivial step

Ask:
- Did this step directly help deliver the requested outcome?
- Did I learn something that changes scope, or only implementation?
- Am I about to do more than the user asked?

### After a user correction

Treat the correction as a hard boundary update.

Then:
- Remove the old broader plan.
- Do not defend the discarded work.
- Continue from the narrowed scope.
- If needed, acknowledge briefly and move on.

## Decision Rules

Use these rules in order:

1. Prefer the most direct artifact first.
   - Open the relevant file before scanning the whole repo.
   - Inspect the specific failing path before designing a general framework.

2. Prefer the smallest complete fix.
   - Solve the asked problem before improving related systems.
   - Avoid bonus work unless it is required for correctness.

3. Prefer internal correction over user interruption.
   - If you can shrink back to scope confidently, do it.
   - Ask only when the next step changes deliverables, risk, or ownership.

4. Treat repeated user constraints as priority signals.
   - A repeated instruction means your execution style is currently misaligned.
   - Tighten scope immediately.

5. Separate categories of work.
   - Code change, investigation, production remediation, cleanup, and documentation are distinct tasks unless the user explicitly combines them.

## Good Intervention Style

When you must pause, keep it short and specific:

- State the potential drift in one sentence.
- Name the tradeoff or boundary.
- Offer the smallest on-scope option first.

Example:

"Quick alignment check: I can keep this to the code fix only, or also add an ops cleanup step. I'll stick to the code fix unless you want both."

## Anti-Patterns

Do not:

- Create cleanup scripts, docs, or side tools just because they seem useful.
- Broaden the task after discovering a neighboring problem.
- Continue with a plan the user has already rejected.
- Justify drift with "best practice" when the user asked for a narrower deliverable.
- Hide extra work inside a larger patch.

## Final Check Before Responding

Before sending the final answer, verify:

- The delivered work matches the requested outcome.
- No extra deliverables were added without confirmation.
- Any assumptions are stated briefly.
- Suggested next steps are optional, not bundled into the completed work.

const COMPACT_PROMPT_BASE = `Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
